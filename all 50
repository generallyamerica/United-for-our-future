United for Our Future
ABOUT: Decentralized • Mirror-friendly • No external deps
A simple, portable page for peaceful civic coordination. You can copy, host, and share this file anywhere. No logins. No databases. No gatekeepers. JUST USE YOUR BRILLIANT BRAIN!
PURPOSE:
This page explains a SIMPLE, LAWFUL, NON-VIOLENT call to coordinated civic action, beginning with a General Strike.
	•	WHEN: Beginning IDEALLY early-mid November 25’
	•	WHAT: Firstly, a General Strike.
	•	WHY: The world doesn’t change when the powerful decide to be kind — it changes when ordinary people remember their own power.
Silence has never protected the vulnerable; it’s only ever protected the system built to exploit them.
PRETENDING everything’s fine is just a lullaby for the comfortable, and we are wide awake.
Because DICTATORS, authoritarians, and tyrants only stand as long as their people stay on their knees and take it — and I am confident we are done kneeling.
Because we still believe in something sacred: that freedom, compassion, and truth are worth defending together, peacefully but relentlessly, to survive the inevitable of what this country is moving into, and rebuild on the other side.
