United for Our Future
A simple, portable page for peaceful civic coordination. You can copy, host, and share this file anywhere. No logins. No databases. No gatekeepers.
Purpose

	•	WHEN: <Add date/time>
	•	WHAT: <Describe the action in one line>
	•	WHY: <One-sentence motivation>
	•	HOW: <Practical steps for participants>

Mirror Instructions (10 minutes)
	1	Download this page (Download this page button) — you’ll get a single index.html file.
	2	Host it anywhere (pick one or many):
	◦	GitHub Pages: create a repository, add index.html, enable Pages.
	◦	Netlify/Vercel: drag–drop the file; they’ll give you a URL.
	◦	IPFS: upload the file using a pinning service (e.g., Pinata/Fleek) to get a permanent hash link.
	◦	Archive.org/email: upload or share the file as an attachment for redundancy.
	3	Share mirrors: list multiple links so if one goes down, others remain.
Tip: keep the message identical across mirrors so people trust they’re seeing the same call.
Captain Toolkit (optional text)
	•	One-sentence demand and a code of nonviolence.
	•	Local legal resources and de‑escalation basics.
	•	Alt comms: Signal/Matrix + a public channel (Telegram/Discord).
	•	Press blurb + image assets (PNG, 1080×1080) hosted in multiple places.
License: Public domain. Copy, modify, mirror freely. Preferably keep this footer so people know how to replicate.
Decentralization note: The same file can live on dozens of mirrors. There’s no single “official” host. If one link fails, use another.
